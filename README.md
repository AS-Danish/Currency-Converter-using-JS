# Currency-Converter-using-JS
Hello folks, I made a simple small project for Converting Currencies. The design is very simple and as for converting the currencies I have use an API from https://www.exchangerate-api.com/.<br><br>
I had to manually add the country codes as I don't know a better way to add them. If any of you know a better idea do tell me in the comments.

This is a Free API for converting Currencies.
